# Summary
Climatic change alters the frequency and intensity of natural hazards. In order to assess potential future changes in flood seasonality in the Rhine River Basin, we analyse changes in precipitation, snowmelt, evapotranspiration and streamflow at 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0Â°C global warming levels. The mesoscale Hydrological Model (mHM) forced with an ensemble of climate projection scenarios (five general circulation models under three representative concentration pathways) is used to simulate the present and future climate conditions of both, pluvial and nival hydrological regimes. This repository stores R-code used to analyse and visualize model input and calibration results (input_calib.R), assess the performance of simulations with historic GCM forcing (gcm_hist.R) and investigate projected changes in streamflow, snowmelt, precipitation (total and liquid) and evapotranspiration (fut_seas.R).
